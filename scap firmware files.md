# .scap files info displaying

Since Version 19-4-2024 the Dumper displays basic info for firmware update files.

What are .scap files?   

In summary, .scap files are proprietary firmware capsules used by Apple to securely package and distribute firmware updates for the low-level system components of Mac computers. Extracting and modifying them requires specialized knowledge and tools.

As some of these firmware files contain information in their header, the Dumper displays them, if possible.
